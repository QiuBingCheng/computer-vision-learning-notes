# Limitations of traditional CV

## Feature Engineering for Image Pattern Recognition
### Focus during this time was feature extraction and manual feature engineering 
### Techniques included detecting corners, diagonal lines, oriented edges, and shapes
### It can be difficult to identify complicated objects because there are endless ways to combine their features
### Classification techniques included template matching, Gaussian models, SVMs, and random forests

## Limitations of POre-Deep Learning Methods
### Professionals with expretise in the field are needed to understand data and extract features correctly
### Features engineering requires a significant amount of manual effort from humans
### Working with complicated visual data is problematic because of occlusions,lighting changes, and deformations
### Diffcult to geeralize to new and diverse patterns

## Advancements from SIFT and HOG to Deep Learning in Computer Vision
